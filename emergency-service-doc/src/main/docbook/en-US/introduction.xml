        <title>Why Emergency Services?</title>
    
        <para>
            The Emergency Service Application was built as a blue print for architect applications using 
            the Drools and jBPM5 platform. The main goal of this application is to show how we can model and implement 
            a complete and complex business scenario using declarative approaches like: 
            Business Rules, Business Process and Complex Event Processing. 
        </para>
        <para>From the technical point of view, this application shows how components like a Rule Engine and 
            Business Process Engine can be integrated with technologies that are widely used in most system architectures. 
            Components -- like Distributed Caches, Transactional Frameworks, Messaging Systems, Web Services 
            Stacks and Web Frameworks -- can be combined to work around the declarative power of rules, processes and events.
        </para>

        <title>Application Scope, Domain and Requirements</title>
        <para>
            The application was created to represent complex scenarios that are being executed by an Emergency Services 
            company that deals with concurrent emergencies within a city. The company needs to solve different situations 
            where different entities need to be coordinated to deal with an emergency situation. 
        </para>
        <para>
            The Emergency Services Application shows how we can provide a tool that helps the company to improve their services 
            by giving them full visibility of their actions, traceability of their resources, suggestions and advice based on 
            the context without sacrificing any degree of flexibility that they need to solve real life situations. One of the most 
            important requirements of the application is related to the the fact that most of the emergencies can be classified 
            under different categories based on their characteristics. We can model guidelines to solve each of these categories 
            but in real life, each emergency will be treated differently, depending on the context, the state of the company and 
            their resources. For each particular situation, different actions will be evaluated, suggested and executed. 
        </para>
        <para>
            Two generic situations will be described by this paper: Heart Attack Emergencies and Fire Related Emergencies. 
            But the application is in no way limited to these two scenarios.
        </para>
        <para>
            To design the application we gather, understand and formalize the knowledge that the company experts use to drive 
            their activities.  The formalization of this knowledge will be introduced in the following sections where the Business 
            Processes, Business Rules and Events modeled for this application are described.
