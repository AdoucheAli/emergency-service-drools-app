            For different reasons, (like time, effort, deadlines, business requirements, environment restrictions, 
            simplicity, etc.) some modules are in very early stages of development. For this reason, you can expect big changes 
            in future versions until we get everything right. Feel free to give us feedback and help us to prioritize
            the features that you think that are the most important in your own projects.
