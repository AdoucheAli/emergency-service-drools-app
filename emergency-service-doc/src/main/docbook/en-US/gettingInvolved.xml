            As in every community effort we need your feedback about the features that we are providing in the project. 
            We are open to suggestions and we are willing to help people that is interested in using Emergency Service Application 
            to use as blueprint or just to evangelize about JBMP and Drools. We are also available to train people that 
            wants to get involved with the project and contribute with patches, tests, documentation,  
            new modules and utilities. We can help you to get involved and introduce you to different 
            topics that can be developed for the Emergency Service initiative.
