This is Drools Demo Application.
This application was created to show the Drools Platform Capabilities including:
Business Process Management
Business Rules
Complex Event Processing

This is a generic application that can be customized to work of different domains changing only the Domain Object, the Sprites for the Graphical UI, the UI for Human Tasks, the Business Rules and the Business Processes.

We will try to clean and improve the demo application in order to reflect the best practicies to use Drools.

Some configurations Steps:

Inside the pom.xml file: 
 we use a system variable java.library.path pointing to lwjgl that it's being used to render the city map.
In my configuration (Mac OSX) it's pointing to /Users/salaboy/MyApplications/lwjgl-2.1.0/native/macosx/ where the native binaries are located. Notice that you must have the 2.1.0 version of lwjgl that you can download from: http://sourceforge.net/projects/java-game-lib/files/Official%20Releases/LWJGL%202.1.0/ that it's being required by slick 2D.

We are also using the parameter to -Dd32 because bluecove (used for Wiimote) it's not supported in 64-bits machines.

How to run the application:
1) mvn clean install -skipTests=true
2) cd emergency-service-app/
3) mvn exec:exec

Notice that I'm using MySQL5 inside the persistence configuration (persistence.xml file inside src/main/resources/META-INF). You can change to another database if you want or use H2 in memory db. 
The schemas that you need to create inside your database are:
 - droolsflowht: for handling human tasks information 
 - droolsflow: for handling the runtime status
Note: I will rename the schema names in the future.

Notice also that inside the pom.xml file inside the emergency-service-app/ there are multiple references to the lwjgl path. Please update these references with the path where you uncompress the lwjgl native libraries.

Enjoy
